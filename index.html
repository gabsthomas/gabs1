<!--Glitch a .jpg image by editing the source code. Open the digital image file using “text/edit” on Macs (located in Launchpad/other), "Notepad" on Windows, or "text" on Chromebooks (located in App launcher). Make a test glitch: scroll down to the middle of the document. Copy, cut, move, and paste 10-20 lines of code. Hit save. Then open the original image to see what has changed. Once you understand your reference position, you can begin glitching with more precision.   
   
To add your glitch image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then name your glitched image file to the project folder and name it "hero.jpg." If an image is larger than 1200px in width, you will want to resize it speed up load time. Crop image height to ensure desired fit.--> 

<!--The "hero-image" properties are controlled on the style.css document. We know this because the <div> calls the class="hero-image".

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is gabs, and I am from outside of philadelphia. I love soccer, art, piano, my family and music. I was never that into coding and in 7th grade my school makes you take a coding class, we used a site called scratch, I always got confused and didn't understand how to work the system and so I generally have a negative connotation when it comes to coding. I grew up playing wii, and as I got older my little brothe got a VR set that we would play with, and I also played a lot of fifa.</p>

<!--Flexbox uses rows and column classes to create layouts that scale content across devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens. Add images to your project folder and make sure the file name/type matches in your code. Resize images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>How does code affect what we think, do, and how we move through the world? What did you learn about yourself by completing the Dear Data visualization activity? What did the data get right? What did it get wrong? What else does the data say? Do you have any other thoughts or commentary? Code affects everything because everything onilne was originally a code. I learned a lot about myself druing the data viualization activity. I learned that depending on what day of the week it was changed how much I used my devices, along with the amount of time I spend on social media. I think that it is normal for a person my age to spend lots of time on apps like tiktok or instagram, but seeing the actual numbers was shocking to say the least.</p>

  <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
    <p>How has code and digital technology changed what and how we learn? Why is it important to address think about the role code/CS play in our digital literacies? Digital technologies have changed the was we learn drastically. Having everything at our fingertips is totally different from how previous generations learned. For example, my mom told me about how she had to look up words in the dictionary. I don't think I would ever even consider looking in a dictionary for a word.</p>
